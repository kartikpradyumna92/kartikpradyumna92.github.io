### House Price Prediction

[Project 1 Title](/House Price Prediction)
Used Kaggle dataset on House Prices to predict the prices given multitude of features  like area, bedrooms, and more.
Features were correlated to each other and hence suffered with multicollinearity. You could see it in this confusion Matrix.

Used Lasso and Ridge regression since they handle multi-variable data, and multicollinearity well.
This has improved the accuracy, achieved r2 score = 0.7092047042418796 on the test data.
