## About me

Currently a Data Scientist III at Teladoc Health, I lead data science workflow migrations from AWS+ jenkins to Azure Databricks + Cloudbees Jenkins and deliver insights around enrollment trend and product usage. With a strong background across HealthTech and retail, I’m passionate about problem-solving and using data to elevate business decisions and customer experiences.
<br>
My expertise includes Python, SQL, Databricks, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), Data storytelling, and machine learning. I’ve developed and deployed predictive models, such as sales forecasts for convenience stores, to drive impactful results.
<br>
Beyond data, I’m an avid photographer with a love for storytelling through images. Whether in data or landscapes, I’m always exploring and creating.

<br>
Data Story telling on Paris 2024 Olympics. Understand the data around Paris 2024 Olympics and visualize interesting findings.

Storytelling from few point of Views - 

1. Overall athletes POV - <br>
Used Violin chart to understand variance of Age per Gender of athletes<br>

2. An athlete's POV - Novak Djokovic <br>
I am fan of Novak and seeing him win his first Olympics Gold medal was very satisfying. <br>
Used scatterplot to plot his journey to his Gold medal.<br>

<br>
3. Medalists POV - <br>
Plotted histogram for Gold medalists on Country and Discpline level to understand the ranking. We could most medals are won by USA. <br>

### House Price Prediction - Kaggle (2024)

Used Kaggle dataset on House Prices to predict the prices given multitude of features  like area, bedrooms, and more.<br>
Features were correlated to each other and hence suffered with multicollinearity. Below is the correlation matrix showcasing it.
<img src="images/house_price_corr_matrix.png?raw=true"/>
<br>
Used Lasso and Ridge regression since they handle multi-variable data, and multicollinearity well. <br>
This has improved the accuracy, achieved r2 score = 0.7092047042418796 on the test data. <br><br>

### Classifier to predict Automobile closed deals (2017)
Built a Random Forest classifier on high-dimensional data for predicting deal closures, while handling missing data values and outliers. used Inter Quartile Range (IQR) to handle the outliers.
<br>
Results of the Classifer- <br>
- Area under curve: 0.91378991803
- f1_score: 0.905041605482<br>

Confusion Matrix: 

|                | 0 (Closed) | 1 (Open) |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 0 (Closed) |          71809         |          6         |
| 1 (Open) |          770         |          3698         |
