### House Price Prediction - Kaggle

Used Kaggle dataset on House Prices to predict the prices given multitude of features  like area, bedrooms, and more.<br>
Features were correlated to each other and hence suffered with multicollinearity. You could see it in this confusion Matrix.

<br>
Used Lasso and Ridge regression since they handle multi-variable data, and multicollinearity well. <br>
This has improved the accuracy, achieved r2 score = 0.7092047042418796 on the test data. <br><br>
