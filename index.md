### House Price Prediction - Kaggle (2024)

Used Kaggle dataset on House Prices to predict the prices given multitude of features  like area, bedrooms, and more.<br>
Features were correlated to each other and hence suffered with multicollinearity. Below is the correlation matrix showcasing it.
<img src="images/house_price_corr_matrix.png?raw=true"/>
<br>
Used Lasso and Ridge regression since they handle multi-variable data, and multicollinearity well. <br>
This has improved the accuracy, achieved r2 score = 0.7092047042418796 on the test data. <br><br>

### Classifier to predict Automobile closed deals (2017)
Built a Random Forest classifier on high-dimensional data for predicting deal closures, while handling missing data values and outliers. used Inter Quartile Range (IQR) to handle the outliers.
<br>
Results of the Classifer- <br>
- Area under curve: 0.91378991803
- f1_score: 0.905041605482<br><br>

Confusion Matrix: 

|                | 0 (Closed) | 1 (Open) |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 0 (Closed) |          71809         |          6         |
| 1 (Open) |          770         |          3698         |
