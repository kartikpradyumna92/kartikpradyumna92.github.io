  <summary> <b> &nbsp; House Price Prediction - Kaggle (2024) </b> </summary>
  <br>
  Used Kaggle dataset on House Prices to predict the prices given multitude of features like area, bedrooms, and more.<br>
  Features were correlated to each other and hence suffered with multicollinearity. Below is the correlation matrix showcasing it. <br><br>
  <img src="images/house_price_corr_matrix.png?raw=true"/>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: smaller; font-style: italic;">fig: Correlation Matrix of the features.</p>
  <br>
  *Note :* Used Lasso and Ridge regression since they handle multi-variable data, and multicollinearity well. <br>
  This has improved the accuracy, achieved r2 score = 0.7092047042418796 on the test data. <br><br>
